# Integration Plan for OpenCog Components

## Architecture

The architecture of the system involves integrating OpenCog components such as AtomSpace, CogServer, and Utilities into the existing codebase. The key files involved in this integration are `archon/advisor_agent.py` and `archon/archon_graph.py`.

## Core Components

### Advisor Agent
- **File**: `archon/advisor_agent.py`
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `opencog`
  - `opencog.atomspace`
  - `opencog.cogserver`
  - `opencog.utilities`
- **Description**: The `AdvisorDeps` class includes attributes for `atomspace`, `cogserver`, and `utilities` from OpenCog. These components are used to enhance the functionality of the advisor agent.

### Archon Graph
- **File**: `archon/archon_graph.py`
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `opencog`
  - `opencog.atomspace`
  - `opencog.cogserver`
  - `opencog.utilities`
- **Description**: The `define_scope_with_reasoner` function initializes OpenCog components and uses them in the scope definition process. This function is crucial for integrating OpenCog's reasoning capabilities into the system.

## External Dependencies

The following external dependencies are required for integrating OpenCog components:
- `opencog`
- `opencog.atomspace`
- `opencog.cogserver`
- `opencog.utilities`

These dependencies should be installed and properly configured in the environment where the system is deployed.

## Testing Strategy

To ensure the integration of OpenCog components is successful, the following testing strategy should be implemented:

1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for the `AdvisorDeps` class and the `define_scope_with_reasoner` function to verify that OpenCog components are correctly initialized and used.
2. **Integration Tests**: Develop integration tests to validate the interaction between different components of the system, including OpenCog components.
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Perform end-to-end tests to ensure the overall functionality of the system, including the advisor agent and the scope definition process, works as expected with OpenCog components.

## Usage Details

### Advisor Agent (`archon/advisor_agent.py`)

The `AdvisorDeps` class in `archon/advisor_agent.py` includes attributes for `atomspace`, `cogserver`, and `utilities` from OpenCog. These components are used to enhance the functionality of the advisor agent.

### Archon Graph (`archon/archon_graph.py`)

The `define_scope_with_reasoner` function in `archon/archon_graph.py` initializes OpenCog components and uses them in the scope definition process. This function is crucial for integrating OpenCog's reasoning capabilities into the system.
