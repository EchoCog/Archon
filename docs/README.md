## Architectural Principles

### Recursive Implementation Pathways
The Archon system demonstrates recursive cognitive patterns through:
1. **Self-Improving Workflows**: Each iteration enhances the system's agent-building capabilities
2. **Hypergraph Pattern Encoding**: Complex relationships represented as interconnected knowledge graphs
3. **Emergent Intelligence**: Simple agent interactions producing complex behaviors
4. **Distributed Cognition**: Knowledge and processing distributed across specialized components

### Adaptive Attention Allocation Mechanisms
- **Dynamic Priority Adjustment**: Resource allocation based on complexity and feedback
- **Parallel Processing Optimization**: Concurrent agent execution with shared cognitive state
- **Pattern Recognition**: AtomSpace accumulates cross-session knowledge for improvement
- **Predictive Resource Selection**: Anticipatory tool and example recommendations

### Cognitive Synergy Optimizations
- **Cross-Agent Knowledge Sharing**: Shared AtomSpace cognitive substrate
- **Recursive Refinement Loops**: Specialized agents improving each other's outputs
- **Hypergraph Relationship Discovery**: Emergent patterns from node analysis
- **Adaptive Tool Selection**: Evolution based on successful generation patterns
